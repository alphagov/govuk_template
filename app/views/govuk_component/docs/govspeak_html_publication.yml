      <h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>

      <p>Everything we do in the Department for Work and Pensions is about providing security, extending opportunity, and giving people the support they need to transform their lives.</p>

      <p>We are helping the most vulnerable people in our society by addressing the root causes of disadvantage and supporting them to turn their lives around. </p>

      <p>We are ensuring that everyone who is able to work is given all the support they need to do so, while those who cannot are - quite rightly - protected.</p>

      <p>Through Universal Credit we are delivering a benefit system that provides the right incentives, ensures work always pays, and which supports people both to get a job and then to progress in employment. </p>

      <p>We are giving people greater security, choice and dignity in retirement with a safe and sustainable state pension, and the independence of a well earned private pension.</p>

      <p>We are transforming people’s life chances by supporting them to become sustainably employed and increase their earnings. This is key to our ambition to have the highest employment rate in the G7.

      <ul>
        <li>continuing to roll out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-credit-and-other-benefits-quick-guide">Universal Credit</a> through to financial year 2020 to 2021 and extending job search conditionality to a further 1.3 million claimants to ensure that work always pays  </li>
        <li>continuing to provide a range of employment support through Jobcentre Plus, the Work Programme (until 2017) and the new Work and Health Programme from 2017</li>
        <li>supporting people to become self-employed (New Enterprise Allowance)</li>
        <li>offering working families on Universal Credit support of up to 85% of their eligible childcare costs (where the lone parent or both parents in a couple are in work)</li>
        <li>helping parents understand the government’s childcare offer </li>
      </ul>
