govuk_template
==============

This branch shows the three variants of the GOV.UK template.

1. Standard header

2. Standard header with Service title

3. Standard header with propositional navigation.

This branch exists to demostrate how the template should look,
so it can be linked to from the Service Design Manual - Templates guidance.
